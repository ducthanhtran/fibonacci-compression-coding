# Fibonacci Compression Coding
*Universal Code for encoding positive integers into binary code words*

## Theory
According to [Zeckendorf's Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem) every positive integer has an unique representation as a sum of fibonacci numbers such that it does not include any two consecutive fibonacci numbers. We can use such a representation and encode it with a binary code word but instead of using bases of powers of two (binary system) we use fibonacci numbers as our bases.
